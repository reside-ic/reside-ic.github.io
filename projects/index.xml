      <description>Our team is providing technical and software support to the ongoing 2019-nCoV-SARS/COVID-19 pandemic. Much of this builds on tools that we have developed over the previous 5 years, with some ongoing development of these tools to track the research needs:&#xA;orderly and OrderlyWeb, our reproducible reporting framework developed for the Vaccine Impact Modelling Consortium, is being used to coordinate research results amongst our (now distributed) team of researchers in a reproducible and traceable way.</description>

      <description>https://naomi.unaids.org&#xA;A web interface for a model estimating various HIV epidemic indicators at a regional level. The application is used by teams of health officials from sub-Saharan African countries to inform HIV programme targets. The tool was rolled out during a series of UNAIDS-led workshops in Johannesburg and Abidjan from December 2019 - January 2020. The model produces district-level estimates of people living with HIV, coverage of and unmet need for antiretroviral treatment, and new HIV infections.</description>
