Research Software for Infectious Disease Epidemiology - we are a team of 9 research software engineers working within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) and the [Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/infectious-disease-epidemiology) at Imperial College London.

## The team

{{< team >}}
{{< person name="Alex Hill"img="alex.jpg" url="http://www.alexandra-hill.com/">}}
Alex learnt to code after finishing her logic PhD in 2013 and has worked as a full-stack web developer in a range of 
industries since then. Her favourite language these days is Kotlin but she has a soft spot for Javascript.
When not writing code she can often be found gigging as a professional hula hooper (yes, that's a thing!) or messing around 
with her DJ decks.

Emma started out coding laboratory process control for combinatorial chemistry, then survived several years 
in start-ups in the wild West Country before bringing her considerable web development expertise to RESIDE.
Outside of work she spends time singing with two choirs and sometimes making stained glass.

Giovanni is a computer scientist and health researcher. The former CTO of a health tech startup he now works
with the malaria group at Imperial developing individual-based malaria models in C++ and R. Outside of tech,
he paints, makes music, is a keen runner and occasional philosophy reader.

{{< person name="Lekan Anifowoshe"img="lekan.jpg" url="https://github.com/carbowizzy">}}
Lekan has several years of experience in software engineering. He holds a BSc from Cyprus and Master degree from Sussex. Before joining the team, he worked with continuous update project(CUP) research group at Imperial. If not coding, he enjoys watching and playing lawn tennis.

{{< person name="Rich FitzJohn" img="rich.jpg" url="https://richfitz.github.io">}}
Rich was a computational biologist for 15 years before deciding that catalysing research through software was more fun than doing it himself. He's interested in making reproducibility easier and more accessible while letting scientists focus more on science than engineering. Outside of work he enjoys rock climbing and hiking.

{{< person name="Rob Ashton" img="rob.jpg" url="https://github.com/r-ash">}}
Rob started his software career as a web developer in healthcare. He now writes code to try and assist researchers in managing, scaling and communicating their research code. When not in front of a screen Rob likes to spend his time running a scout group, riding his bike and thinking about pie barms.

{{< person name="Wes Hinsley" img="wes.jpg" url="https://github.com/weshinsley">}}
Wes is a computer engineer and scientist, with a Ph.D making tools for ocean modelling, and then moving to modelling epidemics. He enjoys problem solving, Advent Of Code, (especially on 40-year old hardware), and making interactive and graphical teaching games. By night, he plays music and squash, and makes very good tea.

{{< person name="Mantra Kusumgar" img="quokka.webp" url="https://github.com/weshinsley">}}
Mantra studied Mathematics at university and realised most of it won't be used again so he found more applicable addictions like coding in his spare time. Other addictions include but are not limited to: chess, basketball, K-pop, anime, origami, dancing, acting, escape rooms and much much more!
