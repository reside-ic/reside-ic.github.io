Research Software for Infectious Disease Epidemiology - we are a team of 8 research software engineers working within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) and the [Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/infectious-disease-epidemiology) at Imperial College London.

## The team

{{< team >}}
{{< person name="Alex Hill"img="alex.jpg" url="http://www.alexandra-hill.com/">}}
Alex learnt to code after finishing her logic PhD in 2013 and has worked as a full-stack web developer in a range of 
industries since then. Her favourite language these days is Kotlin but she has a soft spot for Javascript.
When not writing code she can often be found gigging as a professional hula hooper (yes, that's a thing!) or messing around 
with her DJ decks.

Carol started off her professional life with a BSc in physics (1984) and MPhil in nuclear engineering from Imperial
followed by a PhD in physics (University of Bristol). She went into scientific and technical software and has 
worked in this area ever since. She has worked mainly with C++, Java and python, achieved CITP (Certification of 
IT Professionals from the British Computing Society, BCS) and is a Scrum Master. 
When not working she is into fitness training and walking and is a volunteer at her church working with children.

Emma started out coding laboratory process control for combinatorial chemistry, then survived several years 
in start-ups in the wild West Country before bringing her considerable web development expertise to RESIDE.
Outside of work she spends time singing with two choirs and sometimes making stained glass.

{{< person name="Nicolas Dolan" img="nick.jpg" url="https://github.com/Nicolas-Dolan">}}
Nicolas previously worked in medical communications as a medical writer and prior to that edited for The Lancet medical journal. Wanting to take on a new challenge, he retrained at a software engineering immersive run by General Assembly. His hobbies include learning foreign languages and obsessing over artificial intelligence.

{{< person name="Rich FitzJohn" img="rich.jpg" url="https://richfitz.github.io">}}
Rich was a computational biologist for 15 years before deciding that catalysing research through software was more fun than doing it himself. He's interested in making reproducibility easier and more accessible while letting scientists focus more on science than engineering. Outside of work he enjoys rock climbing and hiking.

{{< person name="Rob Ashton" img="rob.jpg" url="https://github.com/r-ash">}}
Rob started his software career as a web developer in healthcare. He now writes code to try and assist researchers in managing, scaling and communicating their research code. When not in front of a screen Rob likes to spend his time running a scout group, riding his bike and thinking about pie barms.

{{< person name="Wes Hinsley" img="wes.jpg" url="https://github.com/weshinsley">}}
Wes is a computer engineer and scientist, with a Ph.D making tools for ocean modelling, and then moving to modelling epidemics. He enjoys problem solving, Advent Of Code, (especially on 40-year old hardware), and making interactive and graphical teaching games. By night, he plays music and squash, and makes very good tea.
