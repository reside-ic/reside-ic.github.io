Research Software for Infectious Disease Epidemiology - we are a team of 8 research software engineers working within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) and the [Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/school-public-health/infectious-disease-epidemiology) at Imperial College London.

{{< person name="Alex Hill"img="alex.jpg" url="http://www.alexandra-hill.com/">}}
Alex learnt to code after finishing her logic PhD in 2013 and has worked as a full-stack web developer in a range of 
industries since then. Her favourite language these days is Kotlin but she has a soft spot for Javascript.
When not writing code she can often be found gigging as a professional hula hooper (yes, that's a thing!) or messing around 
with her DJ decks.

Carol has a BSc (physics) and MPhil from Imperial and a PhD (physics) from Bristol. She then felt the lure of scientific 
and technical software and has worked in this area ever since. Working mainly with C++, Java and python, she is a 
Scrum Master and has a CITP, Certification of IT Professionals, from the BCS. 
Interests are fitness training, walking and she volunteers as a childrens' worker at her church.

Nicolas previously worked in medical communications as a medical writer and prior to that edited for The Lancet medical journal. Wanting to take on a new challenge, he retrained at a software engineering immersive run by General Assembly. His hobbies include learning foreign languages and obsessing over artificial intelligence.

{{< person name="Rich FitzJohn" img="rich.jpg" url="https://richfitz.github.io">}}
Rich was a computational biologist for 15 years before deciding that catalysing research through software was more fun than doing it himself. He's interested in making reproducibility easier and more accessible while letting scientists focus more on science than engineering. Outside of work he enjoys rock climbing and hiking.

{{< person name="Rob Ashton" img="rob.jpg" url="https://github.com/r-ash">}}
Rob started his software career as a web developer in healthcare. He now writes code to try and assist researchers in managing, scaling and communicating their research code. When not in front of a screen Rob likes to spend his time running a scout group, riding his bike and thinking about pie barms.
