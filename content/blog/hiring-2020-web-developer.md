[We are hiring!](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/description/MED01818/research-software-engineer-web-development/)  While many people of the department and some of the RSE group are focussed on COVID-19 at the moment, research and public health action on  malaria, HIV, and other diseases continues in the department and we're looking for someone to help us develop web applications that translate research into public health outcomes.

We're looking for a full-stack web developer to join [our team](/about/) to work with the HIV inference group (part of the [UNAIDS Reference Group](http://epidem.org/about-us-0) and [the malaria modelling research group](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/malaria-modelling) to develop user-interfaces to research software being developed within the department. Tools are used by national governments and international organisations across sub-Saharan Africa to plan, allocate, and monitor key global health programmes.

No prior experience with epidemiology is needed as you'll be working closely with a friendly team of computational researchers and with our RSE team.  We write web applications in Kotlin on the backend and modern Javascript (Vue.js and React) on the frontend, and we're developing new ways of exposing in-development research software to the web (see [here](https://reside-ic.github.io/blog/rslondonse-2020/) for details) - you don't already have to be working in these technologies already, just interested in picking it up.

You'll also work with us as we plan other projects within the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis) - see [here](https://reside-ic.github.io/projects/) for a partial list of things we've done.

The closing date to apply is the 26th of April, and the post lasts until 31 March 2022 in the first instance.  For more details [please see the advert](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/description/MED01818/research-software-engineer-web-development) and the [job description](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/jobs/description/MED01818/research-software-engineer-web-development/Job%2BDescription%2B-%2BResearch%2BSoftware%2BEngineer%2B.pdf).
