      <description>After 18 months of heavy use within VIMC and in the COVID-19 modelling response, we have released orderly 1.3.0 to CRAN. This is a major update with many new features (more than 100 PRs since version 1.0.4 was published in early 2020).&#xA;Orderly is our reproducible research framework, designed to keep track of multiple versions of reports and allow researchers to automatically audit and roll back their data, or construct workflows around long running tasks.</description>

      <description>We have released a new version of our cyphr package, which makes data analysis workflows with R much easier. The aim of the package is to make encrypted workflows as easy as:&#xA;d &amp;lt;- cyphr::decrypt(read.csv(&amp;#34;secret-input.csv&amp;#34;), key) ... cyphr::encrypt(write.csv(processed, &amp;#34;secret-output.csv&amp;#34;), key) using modern encryption technologies and taking care of most of the details so that data is not inadvertently leaked.&#xA;This new version has lots of small features which improve the behaviour of its collaborative data process</description>

      <title>orderly 1.0.1 released to CRAN</title>

      <description>We are pleased to announce the first public release of orderly, our reproducible reporting framework, implemented as an R package and now available on CRAN.&#xA;The orderly package was designed to help with a common pattern in reporting, where a piece of analysis might be run multiple times (over say a number of weeks or months) and where the inputs to the analysis might change. Any piece of analysis has numerous inputs (data &amp;amp; metadata, source code &amp;amp; packages) and changes in any of these might change the results of the analysis.</description>

      <title>All carrot, no stick - virtuous circles and useful tools</title>

      <description>A vicious circle of software use might go something like this:&#xA;A user employs a suite of generic software tools, together with their own domain knowledge and sense of good practice, to design their own workflow to get a task done. This workflow starts off with the best of intentions, but really only exists in the user&amp;rsquo;s head. Consequently, as time goes on, as deadlines threaten, corners are cut. Next, the cutting of those corners becomes habitual, and the workflow degenerates.</description>
