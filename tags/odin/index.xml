      <description>Last month we attended (virtually) a GPU hackathon hosted by Sheffield and NVIDIA, in order to learn how to create GPU-capable models to accelerate our simulations.&#xA;We are working as part of the centre COVID response on models of COVID-19 transmission within the UK. The epidemiologists working on the model are writing stochastic compartmental models where populations are modelled as &amp;ldquo;Susceptible&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Exposed&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Infected&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Recovered&amp;rdquo;, etc - movement between these compartments happens stochastically using a set of parameters.</description>

      <description>After a rather long period of gestation, yesterday I merged in a long-running rewrite of odin. This is a major rework of odin which lays the groundwork for future improvements later this year.&#xA;Odin is our package for working with differential equations at a high level - it includes support for the sort of &amp;ldquo;structured compartmental models&amp;rdquo; that we use a lot in the department, compiling these to C for efficient execution.</description>
