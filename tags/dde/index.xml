      <description>R packages that are published on CRAN are tested every night on a variety of platforms and on the development version of R to ensure that they continue to work. In addition, packages that contain compiled code (C, C++ or Fortran) are put through a raft of additional checks to ensure that the compiled code will not cause R to crash. Once an issue is found, the package maintainer gets an email and usually a fairly short window to fix the package before it is removed from CRAN.</description>

      <description>Last week we released the first public version of dde. This package implements a method for solving delay differential equations, which we use with odin to model disease dynamics.&#xA;With ordinary differential equations, you express the system of equations as dy/dt = f(y(t), t); the rate of change of the system depends on the current state of the system and the current time, but with delay differential equations dy/dt also depends on y(t - τ), where τ is a length of time back into the past.</description>
