      <description>TL;DR - if you want to apply an Ingest Pipeline conditionally in Elastic, consider defining it as a processor in another pipeline and setting its if property.&#xA;Background We use Filebeat to ship application logs to Elastic from our Docker containers. Since we dockerise anything that moves, we have many types of docker container, including containers for Kotlin and JavaScript web applications, for APIs written in R, and for NGINX web proxies.</description>
