      <description>TL;DR - if you want to apply an Ingest Pipeline conditionally in Elastic, consider defining it as a processor in another pipeline and setting its if property.&#xA;Background We use Filebeat to ship application logs to Elastic from our Docker containers. Since we dockerise anything that moves, we have many types of docker container, including containers for Kotlin and JavaScript web applications, for APIs written in R, and for NGINX web proxies.</description>

      <title>Continuous Delivery with Buildkite</title>

      <description>Introduction Our deployments at RESIDE typically consist of a bash script or a python script using constellation to bring up a set of docker containers each of which contains a separate part of the application. We might have one docker image for the web app, one for the database, one for redis, one for an R backend API, and multiple workers. We use Buildkite as part of our CI (continuous integration) process to build these images and test them.</description>

      <description>Last Thursday, almost all of RESIDE went to RSLondonSE, a small and friendly one-day meeting of RSEs.&#xA;We presented two posters - in the first we outline the basic idea behind three common JavaScript frameworks (Angular, React and Vue.js) and reasons for choosing one over another. We will rework this poster as a more detailed blog post or article and also as a standalone seminar later this year.&#xA;In the other poster, we present the ideas behind our Naomi project, where we developed a pattern for exposing research software &amp;ldquo;as a service&amp;rdquo; using HTTP APIs and a modern web front end (written in Vue.</description>

      <title>Integrating YouTrack and GitHub workflows</title>

      <description>Like most technical teams we use an issue tracker to manage our work. Our tool of choice for this is YouTrack. We also make extensive use of GitHub and to synchronise our workflow across the two platforms we name our git branches with YouTrack ticket ids, so every pull request corresponds to a ticket. This naming convention makes it easier to track work in progress across the two platforms, plus the custom tool we use to deploy our software can use git to look at which branches have been merged in and auto-update the corresponding YouTrack tickets.</description>

      <description>What metrics should a software team be recording to measure their performance? Should these metrics have a different focus for RSE teams in general, and ourselves in particular?&#xA;In previous jobs in a more commercial setting, I had become accustomed to thinking about &amp;lsquo;metrics&amp;rsquo; in two broad categories - firstly those defining the performance and health of online systems (number of requests served, click through rate, uptime etc), and secondly those measuring the productivity of the team in making additions and improvements to those systems (story point burndown, number of open bugs, feature leadtime).</description>
