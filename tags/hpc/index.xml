      <description>MPI is a standard for allowing a team of processes to solve a problem together. Various implementations of that standard exist; MPICH is perhaps the most well known. Microsoft MPI mimics MPICH on Windows, as does Intel MPI on various platforms. Typically you&amp;rsquo;d then include these libraries in projects written in C, C++, or Fortran.&#xA;Furthermore, recent releases of Rtools have included support for Microsoft MPI. My plan is a couple of blogs on how to get this working, some exploration of performance, and an attempt at testing / CI.</description>
