      <description>Like most technical teams we use an issue tracker to manage our work. Our tool of choice for this is YouTrack. We also make extensive use of GitHub and to synchronise our workflow across the two platforms we name our git branches with YouTrack ticket ids, so every pull request corresponds to a ticket. This naming convention makes it easier to track work in progress across the two platforms, plus the custom tool we use to deploy our software can use git to look at which branches have been merged in and auto-update the corresponding YouTrack tickets.</description>
